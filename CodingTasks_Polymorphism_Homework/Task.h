/*
* FROM task 02.CodingTasks_Inheritance_Homework, there was:
* 
* Create a base class Shape with a protected attribute color and a public method draw().
* Derive two classes from it : Circle and Rectangle.
* Override the draw() method to print the shape's color and what shape it is (e.g., "Drawing a red circle").
* 
* NOW, in task 03.CodingTask_Polymorphism_Homework:
* 
* Implement a function printArea() that takes a pointer to the base class Shape as an argument;
* printArea() should call a method area() that should be defined in both derived classes Circle and Rectangle;
* The area() method should return the area of the shape, assuming Circle has an attribute radius and Rectangle has width and height.
